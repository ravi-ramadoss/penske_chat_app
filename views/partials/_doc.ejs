      <span><b>what is this application?</b></span>
      I got an idea for this application after my first job interview with Penske. I heard about the projects that they are executing there and was very impressed.
      <br><br>
      I thought that it would be a good idea to create a chat application that helps customers return their trucks. Customers can ask information about the return process and the chatbot will provide them with the information they need.
      <br><br>
      I used data from <a href=https://www.gopenske.com/information-anywhere-anytime>https://www.gopenske.com/information-anywhere-anytime</a> to feed to <a href=https://www.pinecone.io/>pinecone</a> vector store. I used the pinecone vector store to search for the most similar vector to the user's question. I used the most similar vector to find the answer to the user's question. I used the document from pinecone to then call <a href=https://openai.com/>OpenAI</a> to get appropriate answer. I have only used publicly available data from Penske.
      <br><br>
      You can find the code for the entire project

      some common questions:
      <br><br>
      - how do I return my truck?
      <br><br>
      - how do I return my truck after hours?
